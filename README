Implements a Digiline IO Expander which can be stacked vertically like a Mese/DigiMese block.
Each side acts like a regular Digistuff IO Expander with a channel and individually
addressable ports but the top/bottom conduct Digiline signals allowing signals
to propagate allowing multiple expanders to be stacked or used to conduct.
